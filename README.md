About
--------
This is an Android application called LearnIt. 

It is created to help learning foreign languages.

This is my hobby project and should always remain free. However, if you want to help it evolve I would welcome forking. The code quality is sometimes poor, but I am improving on the go.

If you by any chance want to appreciate all the time spent for the development - you may want to consider bying me a beer:
