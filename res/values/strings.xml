        Recently I have added the external offline dictionaries support. They are currently used only as a helper. \n
        That is - when you want to enter a new word via "Add New Words" screen, once you click on the "Translation"
        field you will get some possible translations, you may have wanted to use.\n
        This saves you time, you really don\'t want to spend on just switching the keyboard from one language to the
        other.

    <string name="instructions_title">Version %s</string>
    <string name="instructions_method_title">Concept</string>
    <string name="instructions_method_text">
        This app allows you to learn the words even if you think that you are just too lazy to do it. \n\n
        The method, used by LearnIt is simple. \n\n
        Once you have added new words to your dictionary, they start appearing as notifications,
        making it impossible for you to miss them. \n\n
        The click on a notification shows the word you would want to translate and some possible translations from which
        you have to pick a correct one.\n\n

        The key idea is that the notifications can only be closed by picking the correct translation of the word.\n\n

        This whole system makes you repeat the words you learn every day (at most), which ensures remembering the word,
        while putting nearly no effort in learning.\n
        Basically, the app takes away all your responsibility to learn 5 or 10 new words every day. It works for me,
        anyway.\n

    <string name="instructions_dict_help_title">IMPORTANT Information About Dictionaries</string>
    <string name="instructions_dict_help_text">
        To use the dictionary currently you would have to download and put it into your phone\'s memory manually as I
        have still not developed any way to do that automatically.\n\n
        The dictionaries should be put in the sd card, in the folder "LearnIt" (you may want to click "export
        dictionary" inside the app - this will create the folder automatically)
        If you have any ideas, I would love to hear them.\n\n
        The dictionaries should be put in the folder {language_from}-{language_to}. \n\n
        StarDict usually is distributed with 3 files *.ifo, *.idx, *.dict. They all have to have name "dict".\n\n
        So for German-English dict the path looks as follows:\n\n
        /SD_CARD/LearnIt/de-en/dict.ifo\n
        /SD_CARD/LearnIt/de-en/dict.idx\n
        /SD_CARD/LearnIt/de-en/dict.dict\n

        While you are on "Dictionary" screen, and you have some words from your dictionary showing in the list, you may
        long-click them and edit/delete them.\n
